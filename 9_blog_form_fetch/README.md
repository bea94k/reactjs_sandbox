This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Ninth task - wrap-up - food blog

Final school project after the first semester of React Basics - Tina's recipe blog.
Routing between home, blog, specific post and adding new post pages. Blog cards with a "read more" button opening a full page of that post.
Version on the master branch uses axios calls and json-server development server (data from fake DB - data.json). Version on the tinas-recipes branch gets data from data.js file, POST request in onClick for "Add recipe" disabled - all that for the online demo to work without a connection to any backend.
